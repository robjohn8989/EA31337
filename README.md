### Using & Testing

Please be strongly aware that combination of symbol pair, broker, their market gaps and market spreads
can give completely results when trading variety of robots.
The EA tries its best to detect the perfect conditions for its trading, however you need to backtest the robot first
(or test it on demo account), before going into deep waters.
We keep testing, optimizing and improving our bot, but it takes months and years to achieve the perfect shape.

### Important tips

When using this EA for the trading purposes, please read the following tips:

- Take your time to get familiar with the project and how it works.
- Make sure you have tested EA on the demo account first (at least for few weeks).
- It is advised to backtest your configuration before running on live account (see [Testing](#TESTING) section).
- Choose your broker wisely to make sure EA will work as expected. For example:
  - Be aware of your broker spreads and commissions, otherwise high spreads can easily kill your account,
    no matter how good EA is.
  - Start with with the smaller deposit first (use account supporting micro lots, otherwise change your broker)
    to test the broker, market and EA configuration as the whole.
  - Do not use EA in accounts with spreads above 20 points (2 pips) without proper backtesting
    or good results in the demo account, unless risking affordable minimum (micro lots).
  - Be aware that some brokers dynamically sets very high spreads (over 100) when the market is volatile,
    so best opportunity for EA could turn into the worse. In this case, you should blame broker, not EA.
  - Do not use brokers which doesn't allow hedging positions. The EA has not been tested for it.
  - Watch out for brokers who steal pips by closing orders at a price which is less favourable to you by 1-2 pips
    which can reduce the profits made by EA.
- It's recommended to use VPS in order to run EA reliabily (24/7) as often restarts of EA
  or a trading terminal while trades are opened can drastically affect the expected results.
- Ensure to provide a stable internet connection to achieve reliable operation of EA as slow network
  or short disruptions may significantly impact the performance.
- While running on live, keep monitoring your account (e.g. for any warnings/errors in the logs).
- Do not increase any lot size or risk criteria if your tradings are going well.
  The EA will automatically adjust it when needed based on your available balance.
- Be aware that potential profits can be matter of weeks, not days, so please be patient.
  The configuration could be right, but it's about finding a good opportunity.
- Use major symbol pairs (such as EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc), the one which has been tested.
