# Backtest

A backtest is a simulation of an investment strategy used to evaluate
how effective the strategy might have been if it were followed historically.

Backtesting allows to simulate a robot using historical data to generate results
and analyze risk and profitability before risking any actual capital.

It is not recommended to rely on backtest results as trustworthy.
As the past performance is no guarantee of future results.
